# Docker_static_build

## This repo was created to share the code I used in the following Docker tutorial:

Goal: Create a static webpage that displays OS information

This webpage is designed to run inside of a docker container to display the OS of the base image.
Two Docker images I created to go along with this code are as follows  `oscarw99/ubuntu-image`, `oscarw99/debian-image`
