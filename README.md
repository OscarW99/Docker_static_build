# Docker_static_build

## This repo was created to share the code I used in the following Docker tutorial:
**https://youtu.be/hxzhgE2R_gA**

Goal: Create a static webpage that runs inside of a Docker container and displays OS information of the base linux image.

Two Docker images I created to go along with this code are as follows  `oscarw99/ubuntu-image`, `oscarw99/debian-image`
